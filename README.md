# Espresso

Espresso keeps your computer awake from the system tray.

Launching Espresso creates a system tray icon.  Click the icon to inhibit power management and keep your computer awake.  Click it again to return to normal.  Middle-click to quit.

## Dependencies

### Linux

- Python 3
- PySide **or** PyQt4
- dbus-python

### Windows 7

- [Python 3](http://www.python.org/getit/)
- [PySide](https://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide_Binaries_Windows) **or** [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)

## Motivation

Espresso is inspired by [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) and uses the same icons as [Caffeine for Linux](https://launchpad.net/caffeine).  I wrote Espresso because Caffeine for Linux requires many unwanted dependencies including GTK3.
