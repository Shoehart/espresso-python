# Espresso

Espresso keeps your computer awake from the system tray.

Launching Espresso creates a system tray icon.  Click the icon to inhibit power management and keep your computer awake.  Click it again to return to normal.  Middle-click to quit.

## Dependencies

Espresso works only on *nix (for now) and requires
- PySide **or** PyQt4
- dbus-python

## Motivation

Espresso is inspired by [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) and uses the same icons as [Caffeine for Linux](https://launchpad.net/caffeine).  I wrote Espresso because Caffeine for Linux requires many unwanted dependencies including GTK3.

## License

Espresso is freely available under the terms of the GNU Public License, version 3.  The license appears in GPLv3.txt.  See ICONS.txt for icon licensing.
